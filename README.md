Welcome to my Python framework for chord recognition and segmentation from music audio I'm making for my Audiovisual Systems Engineering TFG (Bachelor's Final Project). It uses a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize chords by predicting the root note and chord quality separately. For segmentation, it offers two methods: one based on tempo information, and another using cosine differences from the audio's Constant-Q Transform spectrum.
