Welcome to my Deep Learning framework for chord recognition and segmentation from music audio I'm making for my Audiovisual Systems Engineering TFG (Bachelor's Final Project). It uses Convolutional Neural Networks to recognize chords by estimating the root note and chord quality separately. For segmentation, it offers two methods: one based on tempo information, and another using cosine differences from the audio's Constant-Q Transform spectrum.
